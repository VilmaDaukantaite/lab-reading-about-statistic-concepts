# Lab | Reading About Statistic Concepts

In the future, you will need to understand deep statistical concepts by reading technical articles. As a training for that, it is interesting to start from here. Also, as we have limited time, this is a way to have some self guided learning to understand everything better and have a wider knowledge.

This week you will find some questions here that you will need to answer by documentating yourself. So you will do a different PR for each question (you are meant to answer the questions in different days). Don't hesitate to write as many text as you need and push images if you need them.

Remember for this lab: there is a right answer. But there is no perfect way to explain it (except for in a mathematical way, but this is another story).

## Challenge 1: What is the difference between expected value and mean?
You know both concepts but, is there a difference? Are they synonims? Start investigating. 

Expected value is the average value of a random variable over a large number of experiments
If you have a statistical experiment:

A practical approach results in a frequency distribution and a mean value; a theoretical approach results in a probability distribution and an expected value.

If the sample space is infinitely large, the mean value should approach the expected value.

However, for most of the time, these two terms are interchangeably used.

As a good reference (once you have looked for some information) you have   [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-expected-value-4815bdbd84de) article.
